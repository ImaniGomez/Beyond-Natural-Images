# BEYOND NATURAL IMAGES: A Benchmark for Cross-Domain Image Reconstruction

## Project Overview

This project will investigate how well state-of-the-art deep learning models for image reconstruction generalize across different visual domains. By evaluating CNN-, Transformer-, and Diffusion-based architectures on super- resolution, denoising, and inpainting tasks across diverse image types—such as natural scenes, text, astronomical, and stylized images—we aim to identify consistent strengths, weaknesses, and failure patterns. The findings will provide insights into cross-domain robustness and guide the development of more adaptable, content-aware reconstruction approaches
